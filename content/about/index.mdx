My first foray into the frontend world came, strangely enough, during a 2-week 
hotel quarantine. With plenty of time to kill, I decided to plunge head first 
into <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification</a>. I've been honing my 
frontend skills ever since!<br/>

I'm currently completing <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend" target="_blank">Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path</a> and seeking a full-time 
role. Let's work together!
